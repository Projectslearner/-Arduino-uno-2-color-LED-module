# 2 LED Module using Arduino UNO

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a 2-color LED module using an Arduino UNO. The LED module will alternate between red and green colors, creating a smooth transition effect.

### Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO Board**
2. **2-Color LED Module**
3. **Resistors (220 ohms)**
4. **Breadboard**
5. **Jumper Wires**

### Circuit Wiring

1. **LED Module:**
   - Connect the red LED pin to digital pin 11 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the green LED pin to digital pin 10 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the common cathode (or anode, depending on your LED module) to the GND pin on the Arduino through a 220-ohm resistor for each LED color.

### Instructions

1. **Connect the LED and Resistors:**
   - Place the LED module on the breadboard.
   - Connect the red LED pin to digital pin 11 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the green LED pin to digital pin 10 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the common cathode of the LED to the GND pin on the Arduino through a 220-ohm resistor for each LED.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.

3. **Observe the LED Module:**
   - The LED module will alternate between red and green colors with a smooth transition effect once the Arduino is powered and the code is uploaded.

### Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes the red and green LED pins as output.

- **LED Control:**
  - The LEDs smoothly transition between red and green colors. One color dims while the other glows, creating a smooth blending effect.

### Applications

- **Visual Indicators:** Use the 2-color LED module as a status indicator for various applications.
- **Learning Tool:** Great for beginners to learn about PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and controlling LEDs with Arduino.
